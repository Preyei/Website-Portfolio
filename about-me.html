    <p>Hi, my name is Preye Igoniderigha and I am currently in my third year of my bachelors in computer science at the University of Calgary. 
        A little bit about me is that I love to read, volunteer and listen to slam poetry. One of the many reasons I am passionate about 
        technology is because of its innate capability to shape the lives of those around me and those in the future. </p>
    
    <p>From a young age my mom would often take me with her as she volunteered in various places. So it is no surprise that I grew up loving to 
        volunteer as well. For me it is a way to connect with my community, meet new people and adopt new skills while stepping out of my comfort 
        zone. It is also through volunteering that I found my passion for computer science. I was a coding buddy for the Calgary Public Library 
        teaching elementary kids how to build a game using coding blocks and soon found myself absolutely inundated with the platform that 
        computer science creates.</p>
    
    <p>When I’m not in class, volunteering or building new projects you will find me listening to my favorite slam poems on repeat and reciting 
        them word for word. It really fuels my creativity and gives me new perspectives.</p>
    
    <p>I’m all about supporting initiatives that address the lack of diversity in tech disciplines and I often find myself excited about 
        interdisciplinary environments. Computer science is a big field but I’m mostly drawn to developing software’s, gleaning information from 
        data and keeping information secure. So if you are also passionate about tech, volunteering, data or Cybersecurity let’s connect!</p>
